# Welcome / Willkommen / Bienvenido

Hello everyone! My name is Johannes, others know me as Max.<br>
I am a 20 years old, was born in Germany and I'm half Bolivian, which is why I can fluently speak German, Spanish and English.<br>
I started coding as a hobby around the age of 15, which turned into a passion. That is part of the reason why I started studying Computer Science at the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://www.kit.edu/kit/english/index.php) in October 2024.<br>
My first and favourite programming language is Java. I recently learned the basics of C++, which now is my second favourite language. <br>
I also know JavaScript, (HTML and CSS), PHP, and a little bit of Bash and SQL. <br>
While studying and after graduating, I want to learn more modern languages to be equipped for the future.<br>
Looking forward to working in the industry :)
