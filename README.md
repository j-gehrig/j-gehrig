# Hello! Welcome to my GitHub profile!

#### First, let me tell you some general information about me:

My name is Johannes but you can also call me Max.<br>
I am a 19 year old guy who was born and lives in Germany, though my mother is born in Bolivia.<br>
I am interested in science, especially computer science, physics and maths. My only hobbies are programming and playing video games.<br>
My favourite music geners are Latin, (Intelligent) DnB and Pop.<br>
I consider myself to be an honest and nice person and I really like helping others - maybe because it makes me feel like I have some value in this world. I have a strong sense of justice and I try to minimize Injustice against me or others and it often frustrates me when I can't do anything about it.<br>
Since I can remember I have issues with loneliness and depression, which amplify my laziness, however I am going to therapy now, so I will hopefully cure my depression soon.<br>
<br>

#### Now the part that matters

I was interested in programming since I was about 12 years old, but I sadly didn't have enough patience to fully learn it.<br>
I first tried learning how to code Java using YouTube tutorials, however I ended up only retyping the code of the tutorials without actually coding anything myself, so the learning process was really slow.<br>
I moved away from "tutorial hell" when I was around 16 years old, where I first started to learn how to build a website using Apache and PHP.<br>
At around 17 years old I started to make a Filesharing Website using PHP, however I accidentally deleted most of my code and so out of frustration I decided to stop the Project and deleted all of the remaining code. Since then I started using Git and a bit later GitHub on an old account.<br>
I then started my first bigger project, which I would later finish. It was a js calculator as a school project. You can find [it's repo](https://github.com/j-gehrig/mgsmb-calc) on my profile.<br>
I then started learning C++. It quickly became my favourite programming language, because it matches my style of coding. My first bigger C++ project is a [library for printing a matrix of custom size in the console](https://github.com/j-gehrig/MatrixPrinter).<br>
I also made a Sodoku solver. I wanted to come up with an algorithm myself (without doing any research), but it wasn't too good, so I decided to not upload it to GitHub. I also wanted to make a GUI version of the calculator, sodoku solver and then a sodoku game, and so I chose to learn QT.<br>
However, it's a little too difficult for me to learn as of now, so I'm learning more C++ and I am now becomming better at programming in C++ but I'm also improving at programming in general.<br>
I want to become a software developer in the future, but first I want to study computer science, because I'm interested in it, because I want to improve my coding skills and because I want to use the time available to make more and bigger projects.<br>
