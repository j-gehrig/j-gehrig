# Hello! Welcome to my GitHub profile!

#### First, let me tell you some general information about me:
My name is Johannes but you can also call me Max.
I am a 19 year old guy who was born and lives in Germany, though my mother is born in Bolivia. 
I am interested in science, especially computer science, physics and maths. My only hobbies are programming and playing video games.
My favourite music genrrs are Latin, (Intelligent) DnB and Pop.
I consider myself to be an honest and nice person and I really like helping others - maybe because it makes me feel like I have some value in this world. I have a strong sense of justice and I try to minimize Injustice against me or others and it often frustrates me when I can't do anything about it.
Since I can remember I have issues with loneliness and depression, which amplify my laziness, however I am going to therapy now, so I will hopefully cure my depression soon.


#### Now the part that matters
I was interested in programming since I was about 12 years old, but I sadly didn't have enough patience to fully learn it. 
I first tried learning how to code Java using YouTube tutorials, however I ended up only retyping the code of the tutorials without actually coding anything myself, so the learning process was really slow. 
I moved away from "tutorial hell" when I was around 16 years old, where I first started to learn how to build a website using Apache and PHP. 
At around 17 years old I started to make a Filesharing Website using PHP, however I accidentally deleted most of my code and so out of frustration I decided to stop the Project and deleted all of the remaining code. Since then I started using GitHub on an old account. 
I then started my first bigger project, which I would later finish. It was a js calculator as a school project. You can find [it's repo](https://github.com/j-gehrig/mgsmb-calc) on my profile.
I then started learning C++ and my first finished project is a [library for printing a matrix of custom size in the console](https://github.com/j-gehrig/MatrixPrinter).
I also made a Sodoku solver. I wanted to come up with an algorithm without doing any research, but it wasn't a very good algorithm, so I made the repo private. I also wanted to make a GUI version of the calculator, sodoku solver and then a sodoku game, and so I chose to learn QT. 
However, it's a little too difficult for me to learn as of now, so I'm learning more C++ and becomming better now.
