# Welcome / Willkommen / Bienvenido

#### Some general information about me:

My name is Johannes but you can also call me Max.<br>
I am a 19 year old guy who was born and currently lives in Germany, though my mother was born in Bolivia.<br>
I am mainly interested in computer science, but I also like physics and maths. My hobbies are programming, playing video games and listening to music.<br>
My favourite music geners are Latin, (Intelligent) DnB and Pop.<br>
I see myself as an honest and nice person. I try to be nice to everybody and enjoy helping others, especially with coding, which I feel very passionate about. <br> 
I have a strong sense of justice and I want to minimize Injustice against me or others as much as I can.<br>

#### My personal history of programming

I was interested in programming since I was about 12 years old, but I sadly didn't have enough patience to commit to learning it, and so I barely even started learning.<br>
I first tried learning how to code Java using YouTube tutorials, however I found myself only retyping the code of the tutorials without actually understanding the code, so the learning process was really slow.<br>
I started to commit to coding when I was around 16 years old. 
I remember that one of my first projects was a Minecraft Spigot Plugin (Java) and a filesharing website in (HTML, CSS), JS, SQL and PHP.<br>
I sadly deleted most of my code on accident and so out of frustration I decided to stop the Project and deleted all of the remaining code. Since then I started using Git and a bit later i signed up to GitHub.<br>
Then, I started my first bigger project, which I would actually finish later on. <br>
It was a JS calculator embedded in HTML as a school project. You can find it [here](https://github.com/j-gehrig/mgsmb-calc) on my profile.<br>
This project taught me a few coding principles, such as "don't repeat yourself" and improved my coding skills overall. <br>
After I finished it, I started learning C++. It quickly became one of my favourite programming languages. <br>
My first bigger C++ project is a [library for printing a matrix of custom size in the console](https://github.com/j-gehrig/MatrixPrinter).<br>
I also made a Sodoku solver. To see how well I could do, I tried to come up with an algorithm myself (without doing any research). It worked, but it wasn't too good, so I ultimately decided to remove the project it from GitHub. <br>
In order to improve my skills, I wanted to learn how to make C++ GUI applications. 
That's why I started learning QT and set myself the goal to make a GUI version of the calculator, and possibly in the future a GUI Sodoku Solver and a GUI Sodoku Game.<br>
However, it's a little too time and energy consuming for me to learn as of now for personal reasons, which is why I put that project on pause.<br>
The current project I'm working on, is making a filesharing website from scratch again.<br>
<br>
I will study CS very soon, because I think studying CS will help with improving my coding skills and become a better software developer, as well as paving the path for my carrer.<br>
